# whatsGoinOnInTheKitchen

Project numero dos! Our second project is a full-stack application! This project combines Express, NodeJS, EJS, and MongoDB with our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My application is a simple grocery list generator. The application requires a user login so that the list is persistent and can be accessed and modified at a later date.
